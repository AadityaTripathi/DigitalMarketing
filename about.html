  <h2>Our Journey</h2>
  <p>
    IIIT-Naya Raipur, established in 2013, is one of the premier institutions under the Indian government's initiative to create centers of excellence in information technology. It was set up as a joint venture between the Government of Chhattisgarh and NTPC Ltd., with support from the Ministry of Human Resource Development (now the Ministry of Education). The institute was envisioned to cater to the growing need for a skilled workforce in IT and allied disciplines.

    Located in the planned smart city of Naya Raipur, it began its journey with a focus on fostering innovation, entrepreneurship, and cutting-edge research. IIITNR has steadily grown over the years, gaining recognition for its quality education and strong industry connect. Its campus, designed to support a modern learning ecosystem, reflects the institute's emphasis on integrating technology with education. With its multidisciplinary approach and evolving programs, IIITNR continues to contribute significantly to the advancement of technical education in India.
